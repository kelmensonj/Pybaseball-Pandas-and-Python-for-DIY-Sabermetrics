# Pybaseball-Pandas-and-Python-for-DIY-Sabermetrics
You can't download a csv file of all the statcast data thats ever been made available anywhere, but with the code in this repo its very straightforward. On top of that, since you'll already be using python and pybaseball in order to download gigabytes worth of statcast data, you might as well play around with creating some new metrics - metrics better than MLB's 'Barrel'. Here is a huge 2 gigabyte file I made by using pybaseball to collect the last few years of statcast data:

If you want to look at that file directly I'm sure we could figure something out.

And here is that data transformed in order to create a few metrics invented by my brother. We used this data to create better park factors and better indicators of raw power than you might typically find on Baseball Savant:

And finally, here is an extended video I made about all of this where the metric gets fully explained towards the end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdmdqhmzDyQ&t=85s
