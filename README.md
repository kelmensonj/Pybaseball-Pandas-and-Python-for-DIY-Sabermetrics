You can't download a csv file of all the statcast data thats ever been made available anywhere, but with the code in this repo its very straightforward. On top of that, since you'll already be using python and pybaseball in order to download gigabytes worth of statcast data, you might as well play around with creating some new metrics - metrics better than MLB's 'Barrel'
